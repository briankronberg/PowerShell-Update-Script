## Each step can have a budget

A step that hangs -- winget waiting on a dialog nobody sees -- used to run
until Task Scheduler stopped the whole process at the execution time limit,
with no summary, no toast and no reboot check. -StepTimeoutMinutes, on both
Update-Everything and Register-UpdateEverythingTask, puts a budget on each
step. When a step runs past it, the processes it started are stopped, the
step is recorded as Failed with the reason, and the run continues. Off by
default.

Steps run in-process, so the budget is enforced by a watchdog thread that
stops the child processes of the step. A step that hangs inside a cmdlet in
this process, such as a Windows Update scan that never returns, has no child
to stop and is not helped; the execution time limit remains the backstop.
