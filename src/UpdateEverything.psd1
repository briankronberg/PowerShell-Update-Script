Fixes from a standards-and-spec review of everything since 1.5.0.

## The advice matches the receipts

The status behind the version banner reports which gallery client holds the
receipts on this machine, and the advice follows it: a PSResourceGet lineage
the gallery cannot move is pointed at "Install-PSResource UpdateEverything
-Reinstall" rather than at Install-Module, which answers a different
lineage.

## Robustness

Both Update-PSResource calls pass -AcceptLicense, so a module that requires
accepting a license cannot stall an unattended run. The Python launcher
probe says through Write-Verbose what it swallowed when a py that resolves
cannot start.
